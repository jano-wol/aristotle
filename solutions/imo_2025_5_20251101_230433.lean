Alice and Bazza are playing the \emph{inekoalaty game}, a two-player game whose rules depend on a positive real number $\lambda$ which is known to both players. On the $n^\text{th}$ turn of the game (starting with $n=1$) the following happens:
\begin{itemize}
        \item If $n$ is odd, Alice chooses a nonnegative real number $x_n$ such that
        \[ x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n \leqslant \lambda n.\]
        \item If $n$ is even, Bazza chooses a nonnegative real number $x_n$ such that
        \[ x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2 \leqslant n.\]
\end{itemize}
If a player cannot choose a suitable number $x_n$, the game ends and the other player wins. If the game goes on forever, neither player wins. All chosen numbers are known to both players.

Determine all values of $\lambda$ for which Alice has a winning strategy and all those for which Bazza has a winning strategy.

Answer: Alice wins if $\lambda > 1 / \sqrt{2}$. Bazza wins if $0 < \lambda < 1 / \sqrt{2}$.

The predicate saying that `n` move in the sequence `xs 0, xs 1, ...` is valid.
For even values of `n`, it checks that `∑ k ≤ n, xs k ≤ lam * (n + 1)`.
For odd values of `n`, it checks that `∑ k ≤ n, (xs k) ^ 2 ≤ n + 1`.
